# p2-panda-svelte-kit

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `pnpm install`

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
pnpm build
```

> You can preview the built app with `pnpm preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
